            <p>
                In 1996, Bethesda Care Services (BCS) was started with a vision of reaching out and meeting the needs of the community in Bedok area. Since then, BCS has been serving the children, youths, families and the elderly in need within our community.
                Our range of services include providing affordable before-and-after school care services through the Integrated Special Student Care Centre (ISSCC); caring for the ageing needs of seniors through the Elderly Services; guiding families and youths in life’s challenges through excITE and Family Services, as well as assisting families through the Welfare Services.

            <p>
                We are a group of students from Ngee Ann polytechnic with a desire to help elderly and the result is Purple Project. Through this site, we wanted to ensure elderly got their meals on time and as well help Voluntary Welfare Organisations (VWOs) simplify their volunteer workload as most for their work are done manually.
                Through this site, they would be able to work much more efficiently in turn increasing productivity. Unlike other developers, we believe in understanding the organizations’ specific needs which helps us to craft a system based on their needs.
